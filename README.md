# HyprDograOS
A Minimal, Secure, and Beautiful Arch-Based Linux Distribution (Work in Progress)

## About This Project
Hello. My name is Uday Dogra, and Iâ€™m quietly working on something called HyprDograOS. Itâ€™s a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, built using Wayland and the Hyprland window manager. I started this project because I wanted an operating system that feels fast, looks modern, and respects my privacy â€” all at the same time.

Right now, this project is still in its early stages. Iâ€™m building everything from scratch on my own, learning along the way. It isnâ€™t polished or production-ready yet, but itâ€™s something I care about and want to keep improving.

If someone else wants to help, they are most welcome. You can fork this repository, make changes, and suggest improvements or even submit pull requests to contribute to the main project.

## Why Iâ€™m Building This
Iâ€™ve often felt that most mainstream operating systems, like Windows or macOS, are too bloated and full of things I donâ€™t really want or trust. Even among Linux distributions, it sometimes feels like you have to choose between having a good-looking system, one thatâ€™s fast, or one thatâ€™s secure â€” but rarely all three at once.

HyprDograOS is my attempt to combine those things into one project. I want it to be lightweight and responsive, so itâ€™s built on Arch Linux with Wayland and Hyprland. Iâ€™m adding neon-translucent themes and dynamic wallpapers to give it a fresh, clean look that still feels subtle. Security is also important to me, so Iâ€™m including pre-configured tools like UFW, Fail2Ban, AppArmor, and Firejail. Thereâ€™s no telemetry or vendor lock-in because I believe people should have control over their own data.

I also want it to be easy to install. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m working on integrating the Calamares GUI installer, so even people who arenâ€™t familiar with Arch Linux can get it set up.

## Editions Planning
Instead of offering multiple editions like Minimal or Security-focused versions, Iâ€™m focusing on building two main versions of HyprDograOS.

One version will be designed for desktop and laptop systems, offering a complete Linux experience with a beautiful and secure Hyprland-based environment.

The second version is meant for mobile devices. It will be a custom build based on Googleâ€™s GSI (Generic System Image) Android, adapted to align better with the desktop version. The idea is to create a unified ecosystem for Linux enthusiasts where both desktop and mobile systems can work together more smoothly.

I know there are existing solutions like Ubuntu Touch or KDE Connect that try to create a Linux ecosystem across devices, but Iâ€™ve always felt they donâ€™t fully offer the level of control Linux users expect. Features like true TTY access or being able to switch screens over the internet feel limited in those setups.

With HyprDograOS, Iâ€™m quietly hoping to bridge that gap. I want both versions â€” desktop and mobile â€” to give users more freedom, deeper system access, and a smoother experience switching between devices without sacrificing control or simplicity.

## Please Keep in Mind
At this point, HyprDograOS is just a personal project. Itâ€™s not finished, and itâ€™s not yet something I would recommend for daily use unless you like experimenting with in-progress systems. Iâ€™m figuring things out one step at a time, usually late at night or early in the morning.

That said, if someone is interested in helping, I would really appreciate it. You can fork the repository, make changes, and submit them back here. Whether itâ€™s fixing something small or suggesting new ideas, any contribution is welcome. Iâ€™m a bit shy about asking for help, but I know projects like this grow stronger when more people get involved.

## The Roadmap Iâ€™m Aiming For
I am hoping to release the first ISO for HyprDograOS, starting with the desktop version, sometime around Q4 2025. After that, I would like to set up an official website and community forum by Q1 2026. If things go well, Iâ€™m also thinking about adding a premium tools and support model by early 2027, so that thereâ€™s a way to sustain the project long-term.

## Who This Is For
This project is mainly for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, developers, and privacy-focused users who want more control over their system. Itâ€™s also for people who enjoy learning and experimenting with custom Linux distributions.
